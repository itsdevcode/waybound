# WAYBOUND

An open-source AI adventure companion that turns nearby places into personalized real-world quests, encouraging people to explore, walk, connect, and spend more time outdoors.

## Architecture Overview

WAYBOUND combines a FastAPI backend with real-world geospatial intelligence and open LLMs:

- **Quest Engine & Progression APIs (Phase 1)**: User accounts, archetype profiles, progression leveling (`level = 1 + (xp // 500)`), atomic quest verification, step/hint progression, and state transitions (`draft` -> `active` -> `completed` / `abandoned`).
- **AI Game Master (Phase 2)**:
  - **Google Places API (New)** (`POST https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchNearby`): Discovers real public parks, monuments, historical landmarks, museums, and botanical gardens.
  - **Minimal Field Mask**: Uses `places.id,places.displayName,places.location,places.primaryType,places.formattedAddress,places.businessStatus` to eliminate expensive review, rating, and photo billing costs.
  - **Gemma AI**: Generates RPG quest narratives and progressive clues.
  - **Anti-Hallucination & Anti-Spoofing Guardrails**:
    - Selects exclusively from real nearby candidate place IDs; rejects invented locations and hallucinated place IDs. Never silently falls back to other destinations.
    - Early clues conceal destination names and landmark identifiers.
    - Sanitized logging: Secrets, raw prompts, and raw LLM traces are never disclosed to clients or logs.

## Provider Modes

WAYBOUND supports explicit provider modes via configuration (`QUEST_PROVIDER`):

| Mode | Description | Verification & Progression Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `demo` (default) | Simulated, fictional scenarios for local development and automated testing. | Observation answers verified against deterministic simulated rules; awards demo XP. Clearly labeled as simulated content. |
| `google_places_gemma` | Live Google Places candidate discovery + Gemma narrative generation. | Requires `latitude` and `longitude`. Strict failure mode: Never silently falls back to demo mode if Google Places or Gemma fails. |

## Real-World Verification Safety & Limitations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Observation Answers as Unverified Hypotheses**: LLM-generated observation questions and answers (e.g., asking what inscription date or statue feature exists at a site) are AI hypotheses and **must not be treated as trusted, field-verified ground truth**.

- **Safe Verification Mode (`ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_REAL_WORLD_XP=false`)**:
  - When real-world AI quests are completed at the verified location coordinates, the destination details are unlocked, but **progression XP is withheld** (`reward_xp_awarded = 0`). This prevents exploiting fabricated ground truth to inflate real-world explorer XP.
  - Set `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_REAL_WORLD_XP=true` only for explicit staging tests or when paired with human/trusted verification workflows.
- **Geographic Proximity**: Arrival verification requires the explorer to be within `VERIFICATION_RADIUS_METERS` (default `100.0m`) calculated via the Haversine formula.
- **Search Radius Bounds**: Google Places search radius must be between `100m` and `50,000m` (default `5000m`). Unsuitable destinations (e.g. gas stations, cemeteries, storage, prisons, closed businesses) are automatically excluded.
